# Baseline Model Results

The results obtained for the baseline gmm-hmm and tdnn models on the development sets provided are displayed below:

|Model stage | WER(in%)|  
|------------|:--------|
| Tri1 - GMM |  16.65  | 
| Tri2 - GMM |  15.90  | 
| Tri3 - GMM |  14.94  |
| TDNN       |  9.68   |

Please note that these are just the baseline model results for the closed set-up. By using additional data for the acoustic model and by including a language model, the results can be further improved.
